# About the project

I am aiming to improve my understanding of react and so I followed along a tutorial by Web Dev Simplified on YouTube to create this simple calculator.

The fully function calcualtor has some aesthetic touches and functions well with good UI features such as commas when the numbers get larger but not if a decimal is added.

During this project I utilized and understood more about cases which were created for the calculator functionality

- Choose_operation
- Clear
- Delete_digit
- Evaluate

This also gave me more exposure to the spread operator which was used multiple times inside the cases to set the state of the caluator.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
